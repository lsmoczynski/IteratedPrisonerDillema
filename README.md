# Iterated Prisoner Dilemma

This app was made to help gather data for my friends BsC paper. It lets you play iterated prisoner dilemma with the most popular strategies in random order, and then export data from the games to csv file.

## Getting Started

Just open `index.html` with browser of your choice.

### Prerequisites

Should work with most modern browsers, but was tested only for newest Chrome. No internet connection needed.
